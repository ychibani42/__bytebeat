# Dynamic Data Sonification Device Using Bytebeat

Project in collaboration with my designer student friend for his art school.

## Overview

This project is designed to transform how we understand statistical data by converting it into music. This auditory approach makes data analysis more accessible and engaging, especially for those who prefer auditory learning over visual.

## Key Concepts

- **Data Sonification:** Converts data into sound and music.
- **Embedded Systems:** Uses C/C++ for programming a microcontroller.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Manages live data inputs.
- **Audio Generation:** Produces sounds based on data.

## Technical Details

### Components

- **Microcontroller:** Manages data and audio output.
- **Sensors:** Capture real-time data for music conversion.
- **Audio Output:** Translates signals into sounds.

## Setup and Operation

- Connect sensors appropriately to the MCU for data input.
  
- Set up audio output mechanisms** (e.g., speakers or headphones).
- Software Installation
- Download and install the necessary software libraries** and tools for MCU programming.
- Flash the provided code into the MCU.
- Running the Device
- Power on the device and begin data collection.
- Audio will start playing based on the data received from sensors.
- Users can experience the fluctuation of data through variations in sound.

## Conclusion
- This project uses sound to make data analysis intuitive and accessible, providing a unique way to experience and understand both statistical and real-time physical or natural phenomena without the need to interpret traditional visual graphs, offering a new perspective on data interaction through music.
